# Contributing to Mobius Loom

Thanks for helping build Mobius Loom.

## Collaboration / Partner
If you want to collaborate directly with the author, open an issue titled:

**“Collaboration / Partner”**

Include:
- who you are (role, background)
- what you want to build
- what resources you have (time, team, funding, compute)
- what kind of collaboration you’re proposing (pilot, MVP build, research track, etc.)

## Non-negotiables (core ideology)
- Wave/Particle duality: every solved trace yields a deliverable (Particle Output) + a structured learning update (Wave Delta)
- Uplift rule: every contribution must uplift the level above it
- Truth vs taste: consensus is fine for subjective preference; verification is required for objective/high-stakes work

## Ways to contribute
- MVP trace engine (Route Card → Threads → Artifacts → Event Log → Rosetta)
- Wizard flows for intention clarification
- Router logic + calibration
- Verification protocols (tests, citations, reproducibility, formal proofs where possible)
- Incentive design and anti-gaming mechanisms
- Examples, demos, and onboarding materials

## How to propose changes
1) Open an issue describing:
   - Particle benefit (what improves for users)
   - Wave benefit (what improves for Rosetta / system learning)
   - Verification plan (how we will confirm it works)
2) Submit a PR referencing the issue.

## Community norms
Be kind. Assume good intent. Disagree with evidence.
