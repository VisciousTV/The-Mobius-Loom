# Mobius Loom

Author: Michael Nathaniel Eid  
Status: Public proposal — free to use, remix, and build upon  
Attribution (requested): Please credit the author when redistributing these documents.

## What is this?
Mobius Loom is a human + AI collaborative intelligence system designed to route problems to the right mix of AI agents and human experts, producing:

- Particle Output: the user’s concrete deliverable (code, plan, design, document, etc.)
- Wave Delta: a structured reusable learning update (Rosetta / Method / Rule / Confusion / Negative Result)

Core rule: every solved trace outputs Particle + Wave.  
Second rule: every contribution must uplift the level above it.

## I want to help build this
I’m actively looking to work with anyone (labs, startups, researchers, open-source builders) who wants to make Mobius Loom real.

If you’re interested in collaborating, please:
- open an issue titled “Collaboration / Partner” with your background + what you want to build, or
- reach out via a GitHub Discussion (if enabled), or
- contact me through the method listed in this repo (see Contact below).

What I contribute best: concept synthesis, product vision, protocol design, and iterating the Loom ideology into practical workflows.
